Source:

- Origin: The dataset is sourced from the Harvard Global Data Institute, specifically from a team of researchers affiliated with the institute.
Year of Collection: The dataset was collected in 2019.
- Link: Hospital Bed Capacity and COVID-19 Dataset

Size:
- Number of Observations: The dataset contains information for 306 U.S. hospital markets.
- Number of Variables: The dataset includes data for hospital bed capacity and models for nine different COVID-19 infection scenarios. (Specify the exact number of variables if available.)

Data Types:
- Numerical Data: The dataset likely includes numerical information such as hospital bed capacities, infection rates, and time durations for different scenarios.
- Categorical Data: Categorical variables may include hospital referral regions, different COVID-19 infection scenarios (20%, 40%, 60% of the adult population), and any other categorical classifications.
- Text Data: Information derived from surveys and directories may involve text data, such as hospital names, locations, or additional contextual details.
